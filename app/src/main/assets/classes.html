    <h1>OOP</h1>
    <div><h2>OOP Terminologies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Class − A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that
                characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class
                variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Class variable − A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class
                variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class
                variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Data member − A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with
                a class and its objects.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Function overloading − The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular
                function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments
                involved.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Instance variable − A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to
                the current instance of a class.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Inheritance − The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that
                are derived from it.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Instance − An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a
                class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Instantiation − The creation of an instance of a class.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Method − A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Object − A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An
                object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and
                methods.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>Operator overloading − The assignment of more than one function to a particular
                operator.
            </li>
            <br/></ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Creating Classes</h2>
        The class statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately
        follows the keyword class followed by a colon as follows −
        <br/><br/>
        <div id="shade">
<pre>
class Employee:
   'Common base class for all employees'
   empCount = 0

   def __init__(self, name, salary):
      self.name = name
      self.salary = salary
      Employee.empCount += 1
   
   def displayCount(self):
     print ("Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount)

   def displayEmployee(self):
      print ("Name : ", self.name, ", Salary: ")
</pre>
        </div>
        The variable empCount is a class variable whose value is shared among all the instances of a
        in this class. This can be accessed as Employee.empCount from inside the class or outside
        the class.
        <br/>
        The first method __init__() is a special method, which is called class constructor or
        initialization method that Python calls when you create a new instance of this class.
        <br/>
        You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first
        argument to each method is self. Python adds the self argument to the list for you; you do
        not need to include it when you call the methods.
        <br/>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Creating Instance Objects</h2>
        To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever
        arguments its __init__ method accepts.
        <dt>This would create first object of Employee class:</dt>
        <dd>emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000)</dd>
        <dt>This would create second object of Employee class:</dt>
        <dd>emp2 = Employee("Manni", 5000)</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Class Inheritance</h2>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Instead of starting from a scratch, you
            can create a class by deriving it from a pre-existing class by listing the parent class
            in parentheses after the new class name.<br/>
            The child class inherits the attributes of its parent class, and you can use those
            attributes as if they were defined in the child class. A child class can also override
            data members and methods from the parent.

            Syntax
            Derived classes are declared much like their parent class; however, a list of base
            classes to inherit from is given after the class name −
            <pre>
class SubClassName (ParentClass1[, ParentClass2, ...]):
   'Optional class documentation string'
   class_suite
class Parent:        # define parent class
   parentAttr = 100
   def __init__(self):
      print ("Calling parent constructor")
   def parentMethod(self):
      print ('Calling parent method')
   def setAttr(self, attr):
      Parent.parentAttr = attr
   def getAttr(self):
      print ("Parent attribute :", Parent.parentAttr)

class Child(Parent): # define child class
   def __init__(self):
      print ("Calling child constructor")
   def childMethod(self):
      print ('Calling child method')

c = Child()          # instance of child
c.childMethod()      # child calls its method
c.parentMethod()     # calls parent's method
c.setAttr(200)       # again call parent's method
c.getAttr()          # again call parent's method
When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −

Calling child constructor
Calling child method
Calling parent method
Parent attribute : 200
        </font></pre>
</font>
