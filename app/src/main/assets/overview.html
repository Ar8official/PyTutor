<h1 style="text-align:center" ;>OVERVIEW OF PYTHON</h1>
<p>
    Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.
    Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other
    languages use punctuation,
    and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

</p>
<P>
<ol
= type="a">
<li>
    Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter.
    You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.
</li>

<li>
    Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the
    interpreter directly to write your programs.
</li>

<li>
    Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of
    programming that encapsulates code within objects.

</li>
<li>
    Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level
    programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple
    text processing to WWW browsers to games.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>
    <p>
        Python Features
    </p>
</h2>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and
        a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
    </li>

    <li>
        Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms
        and has the same interface on all platforms.
    </li>

    <li>
        Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter.
        These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell
        scripting.
    </li>
    <li>
        GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be
        created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC,
        Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
    </li>
    <li>
        Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features.
