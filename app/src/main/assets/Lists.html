    <h1>Lists</h1>
    Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common ones are lists and tuples, which
    we would see in this tutorial.

    There are certain things you can do with all the sequence types. These operations include
    indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking for membership. In addition, Python has
    built-in functions for finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and smallest
    elements.</p>
    <p>The list is the most versatile datatype available in Python, which can be written as a list
        of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is
        that the items in a list need not be of the same type.

        Creating a list is as simple as putting different comma-separated values between square
        brackets. For example −
        <br>
    <center>
        <img src="List1.JPG"/>
    </center>
    </p>
    <h3>Updating lists</h3>
    <p>
        You can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the left-hand
        side of the assignment operator, and you can add to elements in a list with the append()
        method. For example −
        <br/>
    <center><img src="list2.JPG"/></center>
    When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <center><img src="List3.JPG"/></center>
    </p>
    <p><h4>Indexing and Slicing</h4>
    Since lists are sequences, indexing and slicing work the same way for lists as they do for
    strings.

    <h3>Basic List Operations</h3>
    Lists respond to the + and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation and repetition
    here too, except that the result is a new list, not a string.

    In fact, lists respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the prior
    chapter.

    <p>List Methods
        Python includes the following list methods −
        <br/>
    <ol>
        <li>list.append(obj) ----- Appends object obj to list</li>
        <li>list.count(obj) ----- Returns count of how many times obj occurs in list</li>
        <li>list.remove(obj) ----- Removes object obj from list</li>
        <li>list.reverse() ----- Reverses objects of list in place</li>
        <li>list.insert(index,obj) ----- Inserts object obj into list at offset indext</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
